# What the program does is encoding a text into image

# 1-Loads an image and looks at each pixels in hexadecimal value

# 2-Converts secret text into bits and stores them in LSB of pixel bits

# 3-Delimiter is added to the end of the edited pixel values

# 4- While retrieving all the 0 and 1 extracted until delimiter is found.

# Exracted bits are converted into string
